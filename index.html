        <h2>Location</h2>
        
        <p class="location">Victoria Falls is a town in western Zimbabwe and a gateway to the massive waterfall of the same name. Here, the Zambezi River plummets over a cliff and into the Boiling Pot before flowing through a series of gorges. The Devil’s Pool, a natural infinity pool, is on the edge of a sheer drop. Spanning the river is 1905 Victoria Falls Bridge. The surrounding Zambezi National Park is home to white rhinos and elephants.</p>  
        
   <h2>The devil's pool</h2>  
   
    <p>In Devil’s Pool itself, there is a rock lip that protrudes upward which keeps you from falling over the edge. Under the low water conditions that you’re permitted to enter Devil’s Pool, you would have to try really hard to actually go up and over that rock that’s naturally keeping you in. This rock lip seemed thick and sturdy to us.</p> 

 <p>Could that rock potentially give way one day? Perhaps. But that seemed very unlikely in our opinion. Still, like everything in life, there’s definitely some risk here </p>
